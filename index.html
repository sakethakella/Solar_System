                  <h2>Mercury</h2>
                  <p>Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest in the solar system, with a diameter of 4,880 kilometers. It has an extreme temperature range, from -173°C at night to 427°C during the day due to its lack of atmosphere. Mercury’s surface is covered in craters, similar to the Moon, and it has a heavily cratered terrain from constant meteorite impacts. The planet has no moons and completes an orbit around the Sun in just 88 Earth days. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury doesn’t experience the highest temperatures because of its thin atmosphere.</p>

                  <h2>Venus</h2>
                  <p>Venus is often referred to as Earth's "sister planet" because of its similar size and composition. With a diameter of 12,104 kilometers, it’s the second planet from the Sun. Venus is known for its thick, toxic atmosphere primarily composed of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid, which trap heat and make it the hottest planet in the solar system, with temperatures around 467°C. The planet’s surface is obscured by clouds, but radar imaging reveals volcanoes, mountains, and vast plains. Venus has a retrograde rotation, spinning in the opposite direction to most planets, including Earth.</p>

                  <h2>Earth</h2>
                  <p>Earth, the third planet from the Sun, is the only known planet to support life. With a diameter of 12,742 kilometers, it has a diverse range of ecosystems and a mild climate, thanks to its atmosphere composed of nitrogen, oxygen, and trace gases. Earth’s surface is 71% water, with oceans, rivers, and lakes, while the remaining 29% consists of landmasses. Earth experiences four distinct seasons due to its axial tilt of 23.5 degrees. It has one natural satellite, the Moon, and the planet's magnetic field protects it from harmful solar radiation.</p>

                  <h2>Mars</h2>
                  <p>Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, is often called the "Red Planet" due to its iron oxide-rich surface. With a diameter of 6,779 kilometers, Mars has a thin atmosphere mostly made of carbon dioxide. Its surface temperature averages around -60°C, but it can vary widely. Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, and features the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons. The planet also has vast canyons, including Valles Marineris, which stretches for over 4,000 kilometers. Evidence of ancient riverbeds suggests that liquid water may have once flowed on the surface.</p>

                  <p>Jupiter, the fifth planet from the Sun, is the largest in the solar system with a diameter of 139,820 kilometers. It is a gas giant primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter has a strong magnetic field and over 80 moons, including Ganymede, the largest moon in the solar system. Its atmosphere features distinct bands of clouds and the iconic Great Red Spot, a giant storm that has been raging for centuries. Jupiter’s fast rotation causes the planet to bulge at the equator. The planet has a faint ring system, though it’s less prominent than Saturn’s.</p>

                  <p>Saturn, the sixth planet from the Sun, is famous for its beautiful and expansive ring system, made of ice and rock particles. It is the second-largest planet in the solar system with a diameter of 116,460 kilometers. Like Jupiter, Saturn is a gas giant, composed mostly of hydrogen and helium. It has at least 83 moons, with Titan being the largest. Titan is unique for its thick nitrogen-rich atmosphere and lakes of liquid methane. Saturn’s gravity is so low that it would float if placed in water. The planet has a very low density, making it the least dense of all planets.</p>

                  <h2>Uranus</h2>
                  <p>Uranus, the seventh planet from the Sun, is an ice giant with a diameter of 50,724 kilometers. It is unique due to its extreme axial tilt of 98 degrees, meaning it essentially rolls around the Sun on its side. Its atmosphere is composed mainly of hydrogen, helium, and methane, which gives the planet its blue-green color. Uranus has 27 moons and faint rings that are difficult to see. Its cold temperature, around -224°C, makes it one of the coldest planets. Uranus was the first planet discovered with a telescope by William Herschel in 1781.</p>

                  <h2>Neptune</h2>
                  <p>Neptune, the eighth planet from the Sun, is an ice giant with a diameter of 49,244 kilometers. Its atmosphere contains hydrogen, helium, and methane, which gives the planet its striking blue color. Neptune is known for having the strongest winds in the solar system, reaching speeds of over 2,100 kilometers per hour. Its largest moon, Triton, has geysers that shoot nitrogen gas into space. Neptune has a faint ring system and 14 known moons. Its distance from the Sun means it has long seasons, with one year on Neptune lasting 165 Earth years. It was discovered in 1846.</p>
